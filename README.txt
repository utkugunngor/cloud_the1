Welcome to Utku's Meme Generator!
It has a very simple user interface. At the first page, you can choose either:
1)Generate meme using an image url
2)Generate meme using a local image
After clicking one of those;
- There will be two boxes for upper and lower text inputs on both pages.
- A box for image url(for the first choice) 
- A form for choosing image(for the second choice)
Then, click submit and your meme is ready!

After generating one, you might need to go back and do the whole process for another meme, this part is not so user friendly. But it is not that hard as well. Enjoy!
